# OWL-TLS
OWL (Obscured Wire Layer) is a pure JavaScript end-to-end encrypted messaging scheme that can be used in any medium - including but not limited to avian carriers. The underlying encryption protocol is TLS 1.2, implemented by the excellet [forge](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge) library.

This is a strictly educational tool, which can help demonstrating how TLS and public-key encryption systems works, and also proves that end-to-end encrpytions can be used over practically any transport, including SMS, emails, postcards, and tiny notes delivered by pegions. While in theory, using TLS 1.2 with proper encrpytion parameters is considered secured, in practice this is an educational tool implemented in JavaScript and running inside a browser, and therefore might have some volunrabilities or weakness that can make it unsecured. If you need a proper encyption, consider tools that provide high level of security and confidentiality, such as [GPG](https://gnupg.org/), [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) and more.

## How to use

## Development

### Requirements

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
